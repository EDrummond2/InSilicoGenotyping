# InSilicoGenotyping
Imputing mtDNA genotyping data to weighted haplogroup predictions, and weighted variant lists. 

Being able to convert any library of mtDNA sequence to look like the barcode-like information 
structure seen using chemical microarray genotyping has several uses.  

This code accepts a list of polymorphisms found in the the samples in the library and enables ISG
to predict how each polymorphism would influence the microarray's answer at each of the loci it
interrogates.
